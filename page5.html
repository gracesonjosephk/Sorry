            I want to be honest about why it happened. You didn’t do anything wrong.
            I was already overwhelmed, and I let that frustration come out the wrong way.

            I am really sorry. You didn’t do anything wrong, but I still acted that way. There were many things upsetting me, and even though you were not the cause, I let it out on you. I’m truly sorry for that.
            Many things were going on, and the stress was very high. I was trying my best to handle everything, and honestly, I just wanted to get some good sleep and eat biryani. I tried my best to take all the pressure in. I am a certified overthinker, so you can’t imagine what was going on in my mind.
            I think I can be honest with you. Since my work hours were reduced, I’ve been struggling financially as well. I know we all want to go on a trip together, but I don’t know if I’ll be able to manage it. That was one thing among many.
            Then there was job stress too. I was 98% sure I would get a job, and they sent me a rejection just before I started cooking, mainly because I’m on OPT. My mind was in a lot of trouble at that moment. There were other factors as well.
            I felt special, until I realized you talk to everybody like that. I know that, and I don’t know… maybe I’m a fool. I’m trying, even though it’s hard. Sometimes I get jealous too. I can’t fully control it, but I am trying my best.
            I know I can’t force you to choose me, no matter how much I want you to. I was never anyone’s first choice, so I’m kind of used to standing behind someone I can’t have.
            I can handle one or two things at a time, but many things came together, and my mind completely shut down. I’m sorry. You had nothing to do with it, and I was rude to you
